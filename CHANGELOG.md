# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Cross-platform architecture support for Nginx service
  - Added dynamic platform selection using `DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM` environment variable
  - Maintains backward compatibility with WSL and x86_64 systems
  - Adds native support for ARM64 architecture (Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3)
- Multi-architecture support for Nginx image (AMD64 and ARM64)
- Docker buildx configuration for cross-platform builds
- Automated build script for multi-arch images

#### Platform Configuration
To specify the platform for your system:
- For ARM64 (Apple Silicon): `export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/arm64`
- For AMD64 (Intel/AMD): `export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64`
- Default fallback: AMD64 if not specified

You can set this:
1. In your shell profile for persistence
2. Before running docker-compose: `DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/arm64 docker-compose up`
3. In your CI/CD environment variables

### Changed
- Updated docker-compose.yml to use pre-built multi-arch images
- Improved ARM64 compatibility for Apple Silicon Macs
